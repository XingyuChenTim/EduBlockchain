  The EduBlockchain is a web application of blockchain which could assist the future blockchain related curriculum.
  
  
## Introduction
 
In recent years, Blockchain technology is growing very fast and there is tons of complex information about Blockchain but there is no clear guideline application for amateurs to learn from this new technology. According to Professor Chen’s requirement, our team needs to build a web based simulation which relates to blockchain technology. 

This application has been used for educational purposes to help students understand the basic structure of blockchain and why it can be considered as decentralized systems.More specifically, the web application should offer several efficient functions of query and storing information that include user’s data and blocked data. 

Developing such web applications and having hands-on practice in such an environment should stimulate students’ interests of learning and exploring fundamentals of blockchain technology, especially for future CS undergrad students who are interested in blockchain-related studies.
